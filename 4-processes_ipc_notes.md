## 1. Introduction to Processes

### What is a Process?

A **process** is a program in execution - it's the unit of work in modern operating systems. Think of it like this:

- **Program**: A recipe written in a cookbook (static code on disk)
- **Process**: Actually cooking the recipe in your kitchen (dynamic execution in memory)

When you double-click on an application like a text editor, the operating system creates a process to run that program. The process includes:
- The program code (instructions)
- Current activity (program counter, registers)
- Memory space (stack, heap, data)
- System resources (open files, network connections)

### Real-World Analogy
Imagine a restaurant kitchen:
- **Recipe** = Program (static instructions)
- **Chef cooking** = Process (dynamic execution)
- **Kitchen resources** = System resources (memory, CPU, files)
- **Multiple chefs** = Multiple processes running simultaneously

---

## 2. System Calls

### What are System Calls?

System calls are **well-defined entry points** through which user programs interact with the operating system kernel to request services. They act as a bridge between user space and kernel space.

### Analogy: The Restaurant Metaphor
Think of system calls like ordering at a restaurant:
- **You (user program)**: Can't go into the kitchen directly
- **Waiter (system call)**: Takes your order and communicates with the kitchen
- **Kitchen (kernel)**: Prepares your food using specialized equipment
- **Menu (system call interface)**: Defines what services are available

### Why System Calls are Necessary

System calls exist for several critical reasons:

1. **Security**: Prevent processes from accessing other processes' data
2. **Resource Management**: Fair allocation of system resources
3. **Hardware Abstraction**: Standardized way to access hardware
4. **Stability**: Protect the kernel from buggy user programs

### Without System Calls - Problems:
```
❌ Process A could read Process B's memory
❌ Programs could directly control hardware
❌ No fair resource sharing
❌ System crashes from user errors
```

### With System Calls - Benefits:
```
✅ Controlled access to resources
✅ Security isolation between processes
✅ Standardized interface
✅ System stability
```

### Common System Call Examples

| System Call | Purpose | Example Usage |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| `open()` | Open a file | `open("file.txt", O_RDONLY)` |
| `read()` | Read from file/device | `read(fd, buffer, size)` |
| `write()` | Write to file/device | `write(fd, data, size)` |
| `fork()` | Create new process | `pid = fork()` |
| `exec()` | Execute new program | `exec("ls", "-l")` |
| `wait()` | Wait for child process | `wait(&status)` |

### Behind the Scenes: File Copy Example
When you run `cp file1.txt file2.txt`, the system makes these calls:
1. `open("file1.txt", O_RDONLY)` - Open source file
2. `open("file2.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT)` - Create destination file
3. Loop: `read()` from source, `write()` to destination
4. `close()` both files

The OS executes thousands of system calls per second!

---

## 3. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

### What are APIs?

APIs are **sets of rules and tools** that define how software components should interact. They're like contracts that specify:
- What functions are available
- What parameters they expect
- What they return
- How to use them properly

### System Calls vs APIs

| Aspect | System Calls | APIs |
|--------|--------------|------|
| Level | Kernel interface | Library interface |
| Purpose | OS services | Code reusability |
| Example | `read()`, `write()` | `printf()`, `fopen()` |
| Complexity | Low-level | High-level |

### Example: File I/O
```c
// Using system calls (low-level)
int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
read(fd, buffer, 100);
close(fd);

// Using API (high-level)
FILE *fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");
fgets(buffer, 100, fp);
fclose(fp);
```

The API (`fopen`, `fgets`) internally uses system calls but provides a more convenient interface.

---

## 4. Process Creation

### Fork System Call

The `fork()` system call creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. It's like cellular division!

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Parent Process**: The original process that calls `fork()`
- **Child Process**: The new process created by `fork()`
- **Return Value**: 
  - In parent: Child's PID (Process ID)
  - In child: 0
  - On error: -1

#### Fork Behavior Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    printf("Before fork - My PID: %d, My PPID: %d\n", getpid(), getppid());
    
    pid_t pid = fork();
    
    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process - My PID: %d, Parent PID: %d\n", 
               getpid(), getppid());
    } else if (pid > 0) {
        // Parent process
        printf("Parent process - My PID: %d, Created child with PID: %d\n", 
               getpid(), pid);
    } else {
        // Fork failed
        printf("Fork failed!\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}

```
output - 

Before fork - My PID: 1234, My PPID: 1000
Parent process - My PID: 1234, Created child with PID: 1235
Child process - My PID: 1235, Parent PID: 1234

Shell (PID: 1000)
    |
    └── Parent Process (PID: 1234, PPID: 1000)
        |
        └── Child Process (PID: 1235, PPID: 1234)

### Exec Family of Functions

After `fork()`, both parent and child run the same code. To run different programs, we use `exec()` family functions:

- `execl()`, `execlp()`, `execle()`
- `execv()`, `execvp()`, `execve()`

#### Example: Running a Different Program
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    
    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process - run 'ls' command
        execlp("ls", "ls", "-l", NULL);
        printf("This won't print if exec succeeds\n");
    } else {
        // Parent process continues
        printf("Parent waiting for child...\n");
        wait(NULL);  // Wait for child to complete
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Process Hierarchy

In Unix/Linux systems, processes form a tree structure:

```
init (PID 1)
├── bash (shell)
│   ├── gcc (compiler)
│   └── ./myprogram
│       ├── child1
│       └── child2
└── systemd services
    ├── sshd
    └── httpd
```

#### Key Points:
- Every process has a parent (except init)
- Parent processes can wait for children
- Orphaned processes are adopted by init
- Zombie processes occur when parent doesn't wait

---

## 5. Types of Processes

### Independent Processes

**Independent processes** don't share data and don't affect each other's execution.

#### Characteristics:
- Own memory space
- Cannot access other processes' data
- Execution is isolated

#### Examples:
- Text editor (Notepad) running simultaneously with a system backup
- Calculator app while music player is running
- Multiple browser windows (in some browsers)

### Cooperative Processes

**Cooperative processes** share data and work together to accomplish tasks.

#### Characteristics:
- Share data or resources
- Coordinate their activities
- May synchronize their execution

#### Examples:
- Web browser: fetching process + rendering process
- Database: query processor + storage manager
- Compiler: lexer + parser + code generator

### Daemon Processes

**Daemon processes** are background processes that run without user interaction.

#### Characteristics:
- Start at boot time
- Run continuously
- Provide system services
- No controlling terminal

#### Common Daemons:
| Daemon | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `sshd` | Handle SSH connections |
| `httpd` | Serve web content |
| `cupsd` | Manage printers |
| `systemd` | System and service manager |
| `cron` | Schedule tasks |

## 6. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

### Overview of IPC Methods

When processes need to communicate, they use IPC mechanisms:

```
Process A ←→ IPC Mechanism ←→ Process B
```

### Two Main Categories:

1. **Shared Memory**: Processes share a common memory region
2. **Message Passing**: Processes exchange data through the OS

### Shared Memory

#### Concept:
Multiple processes can access the same memory region directly.

#### Analogy:
Think of shared memory like a whiteboard in a meeting room:
- Multiple people (processes) can read and write on it
- Fast communication (direct access)
- Need coordination to avoid conflicts
- Everyone sees changes immediately

#### Types:
- **POSIX Shared Memory**: Modern, portable standard
- **System V Shared Memory**: Older, Unix-specific

#### Example Workflow:
```c
// Process A creates shared memory
int shm_fd = shm_open("/myshm", O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0666);
ftruncate(shm_fd, SIZE);
char *data = mmap(0, SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, shm_fd, 0);

// Process B attaches to same shared memory
int shm_fd = shm_open("/myshm", O_RDWR, 0666);
char *data = mmap(0, SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, shm_fd, 0);
```

#### Advantages:
- ✅ Very fast (direct memory access)
- ✅ Efficient for large data
- ✅ No system call overhead after setup

#### Disadvantages:
- ❌ Complex synchronization needed
- ❌ Security concerns (shared access)
- ❌ Platform-specific implementations

### Message Passing

#### Concept:
Processes communicate by explicitly sending and receiving messages through the OS.

#### Analogy:
Like sending letters through postal service:
- Each process has a mailbox
- OS delivers messages
- Secure and reliable
- Slower than face-to-face (shared memory)

#### Characteristics:
- No shared memory between processes
- Data exchange via system calls
- OS handles synchronization
- Slower than shared memory

#### Methods:
1. **Pipes**
2. **Named Pipes (FIFOs)**
3. **Message Queues**
4. **Sockets**

### Pipes

#### Ordinary Pipes:
- **Temporary** communication channel
- **Unidirectional** (one-way communication)
- Between **related processes** (parent-child)

#### Analogy:
Like a simple tube between two rooms where you can only send items in one direction.

#### Example:
```bash
# Command line pipe
ls -l | grep ".txt"
```

#### In C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int pipefd[2];
    pipe(pipefd);  // Create pipe
    
    if (fork() == 0) {
        // Child process - writer
        close(pipefd[0]);  // Close read end
        write(pipefd[1], "Hello Parent!", 14);
        close(pipefd[1]);
    } else {
        // Parent process - reader
        close(pipefd[1]);  // Close write end
        char buffer[100];
        read(pipefd[0], buffer, 100);
        printf("Received: %s\n", buffer);
        close(pipefd[0]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Named Pipes (FIFOs)

#### Characteristics:
- **File-based** communication
- Allows **unrelated processes** to communicate
- **Bidirectional** communication possible
- Persistent in file system

#### Analogy:
Like a mailbox on the street - any process that knows the address can send or receive mail.

#### Creation and Usage:
```bash
# Create named pipe
mkfifo /tmp/mypipe

# Process A (writer)
echo "Hello World" > /tmp/mypipe

# Process B (reader)
cat /tmp/mypipe
```

#### Comparison: Pipes vs Named Pipes

| Feature | Ordinary Pipes | Named Pipes |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Processes | Related only | Any processes |
| Persistence | Temporary | File-based |
| Visibility | Not visible | Visible in filesystem |
| Creation | `pipe()` | `mkfifo()` |

## 7. Practical Examples and Code Demonstrations

### Example 1: Producer-Consumer with Shared Memory

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

typedef struct {
    int data[10];
    int count;
} shared_data_t;

int main() {
    // Create shared memory
    int shm_fd = shm_open("/producer_consumer", 
                          O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0666);
    ftruncate(shm_fd, sizeof(shared_data_t));
    
    shared_data_t *shared = mmap(0, sizeof(shared_data_t),
                                PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                                MAP_SHARED, shm_fd, 0);
    
    if (fork() == 0) {
        // Child - Producer
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            shared->data[shared->count++] = i * 10;
            printf("Produced: %d\n", i * 10);
            sleep(1);
        }
    } else {
        // Parent - Consumer
        sleep(2);  // Let producer start
        while (shared->count > 0) {
            int item = shared->data[--shared->count];
            printf("Consumed: %d\n", item);
            sleep(1);
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Chat Application with Named Pipes

```c
// Server process
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    mkfifo("/tmp/chat_to_server", 0666);
    mkfifo("/tmp/chat_to_client", 0666);
    
    int server_fd = open("/tmp/chat_to_server", O_RDONLY);
    int client_fd = open("/tmp/chat_to_client", O_WRONLY);
    
    char buffer[256];
    while (1) {
        read(server_fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        printf("Client: %s", buffer);
        
        printf("Server: ");
        fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
        write(client_fd, buffer, strlen(buffer));
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## 8. Summary and Best Practices

### Key Takeaways

1. **Processes are the fundamental unit of execution** in modern operating systems
2. **System calls provide controlled access** to kernel services
3. **APIs abstract system calls** for easier programming
4. **IPC enables process cooperation** for complex applications
5. **Choose IPC method based on requirements**:
   - Shared memory for high performance
   - Message passing for security and simplicity

### When to Use Each IPC Method

| Requirement | Recommended Method |
|-------------|-------------------|
| High performance, large data | Shared Memory |
| Simple communication | Pipes |
| Unrelated processes | Named Pipes or Sockets |
| Network communication | Sockets |
| Synchronous messaging | Message Queues |

### Best Practices

1. **Always handle errors** in system calls
2. **Clean up resources** (close files, unmap memory)
3. **Use synchronization** with shared memory
4. **Consider security implications** of IPC choice
5. **Test with multiple processes** to find race conditions
6. **Use higher-level APIs** when possible for maintainability

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Zombie processes**: Always wait for child processes
- **Resource leaks**: Close file descriptors and unmap memory
- **Race conditions**: Synchronize access to shared resources
- **Deadlocks**: Be careful with multiple locks/resources
- **Buffer overflows**: Always check buffer boundaries
