## Introduction to Threads

Threads are fundamental building blocks of modern computing that enable multitasking and efficient resource utilization[^1]. Understanding threads is crucial for writing efficient, responsive applications.

**Think of threads like workers in a restaurant kitchen:**

- The kitchen (CPU) has limited space and equipment
- Multiple chefs (threads) can work simultaneously on different dishes
- They share common resources (memory, utensils) but work independently
- Coordination is needed to avoid conflicts


## Processor Systems Overview

### Single Processor Systems

A single processor system contains one CPU with one processing core[^1]. The core is the component that executes instructions and contains registers for storing data locally.

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Single CPU    │
│  ┌───────────┐  │
│  │   Core    │  │
│  │           │  │
│  └───────────┘  │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Key Characteristics:**

- Only one instruction can be executed at a time
- True parallelism is impossible
- Context switching creates illusion of multitasking


### Multiprocessor Systems

Multiprocessor systems have two or more processors, each with a single core[^1]. These processors share the computer bus, clock, memory, and peripheral devices.

```
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│  CPU 1  │  │  CPU 2  │  │  CPU 3  │
│┌───────┐│  │┌───────┐│  │┌───────┐│
││ Core  ││  ││ Core  ││  ││ Core  ││
│└───────┘│  │└───────┘│  │└───────┘│
└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
     │            │            │
     └────────────┼────────────┘
                  │
            Shared Resources
        (Memory, Bus, Devices)
```

**Advantages:**

- More work can be completed in less time
- Better fault tolerance
- Resource sharing efficiency


### Multicore Systems

Modern multiprocessor systems include multicore architectures where multiple computing cores reside on a single chip[^1].

**Examples:**

- **Intel Dual Core**: 2 cores per CPU
- **Intel Quad Core**: 4 cores per CPU
- **Intel Quad Core with Hyperthreading**: 4 physical cores that can handle 8 threads simultaneously

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│         Single CPU          │
│  ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐   │
│  │Core1│ │Core2│ │Core3│   │
│  └─────┘ └─────┘ └─────┘   │
│                             │
│     Shared Cache & Bus      │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Important Rule**: 1 core can execute 1 thread at a time, so 4 cores can execute 4 threads simultaneously[^1].

## Understanding Threads

### Thread Definition

A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process[^1]. It's a lightweight sub-process that shares the process's memory and resources but executes independently.

**Restaurant Analogy Expanded:**

- **Process** = The entire restaurant
- **Thread** = Individual chef
- **Memory** = Shared kitchen ingredients and equipment
- **Call Stack** = Each chef's personal recipe notebook


### Process vs Thread

| Aspect | Process | Thread |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Definition** | Complete application instance | Unit of execution within process |
| **Memory** | Separate memory space | Shares process memory |
| **Creation Cost** | High overhead | Low overhead |
| **Communication** | Inter-process communication needed | Direct memory sharing |
| **Independence** | Fully independent | Dependent on parent process |

**Browser Analogy:**

- **Process**: The entire browser application
- **Thread**: Individual tabs within the browser
- Each tab can load content independently, but they share cookies, cache, and other browser resources


### Thread Characteristics

**Key Features:**

- **Data Sharing**: Threads within a process can easily share data through shared memory[^1]
- **Low Creation Overhead**: Creating threads requires less time compared to processes[^1]
- **Individual Call Stack**: Each thread maintains its own execution stack[^1]
- **CPU Scheduling**: The OS CPU scheduler determines which thread gets executed[^1]

```
Process Memory Layout
┌─────────────────────┐
│    Code Segment     │ ← Shared by all threads
├─────────────────────┤
│    Data Segment     │ ← Shared by all threads
├─────────────────────┤
│    Heap Segment     │ ← Shared by all threads
├─────────────────────┤
│   Thread 1 Stack    │ ← Individual
├─────────────────────┤
│   Thread 2 Stack    │ ← Individual
├─────────────────────┤
│   Thread 3 Stack    │ ← Individual
└─────────────────────┘
```


## Concurrency vs Parallelism

Understanding the difference between concurrency and parallelism is crucial for thread programming.

### Case 1: Single Core, No Context Switching

**Scenario**: One core, threads must complete entirely before next thread starts[^1]

```
Timeline: ──────────────────────→
Core 1:   [Thread A][Thread B][Thread C]
```

**Analysis:**

- **Threads in partial state**: 1 (only the currently executing thread)
- **Threads making progress**: 1
- **Result**: No concurrency, no parallelism

**Real-world analogy**: A single-lane road where cars must completely pass before the next car can proceed.

### Case 2: Single Core with Context Switching

**Scenario**: One core, but threads can be paused and resumed (context switching allowed)[^1]

```
Timeline: ──────────────────────→
Core 1:   [A][B][C][A][B][A][C][B]
```

**Analysis:**

- **Threads in partial state**: Many (multiple threads partially completed)
- **Threads making progress**: 1 (at any given moment)
- **Result**: Concurrency achieved, but no true parallelism

**Context Switching Process:**

1. Save current state of Thread₁ (registers, program counter, etc.)
2. Load previous state of Thread₂
3. Execute Thread₂ for a time slice
4. Repeat the process

**Real-world analogy**: A single chef juggling multiple dishes, switching between them but only working on one at a time.

### Case 3: Multiple Cores with Context Switching

**Scenario**: Multiple cores with context switching capability[^1]

```
Timeline: ──────────────────────→
Core 1:   [A][C][A][B][A][C][A]
Core 2:   [B][A][C][C][B][A][B]
```

**Analysis:**

- **Threads in partial state**: Many
- **Threads making progress**: Multiple (equal to number of cores)
- **Result**: Both concurrency and parallelism achieved

**Key Definitions:**

- **Concurrency**: Multiple threads in partial state, but only one making progress at a time
- **Parallelism**: Multiple threads in partial state AND multiple threads making progress simultaneously


## Creating Threads in Java

Java provides two primary methods for creating threads[^1]:

### Method 1: Extending Thread Class

```java
class Test extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Thread task should come here
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test t = new Test();
        t.start(); // Important: use start(), not run()
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Override the `run()` method to define thread behavior
- Call `start()` to begin thread execution (not `run()` directly)
- `start()` creates a new call stack and invokes `run()` in that context


### Method 2: Implementing Runnable Interface

```java
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyTask task = new MyTask();        // Create task
        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);      // Wrap task in Thread
        t1.start();                        // Start the thread
    }
}
```

**Advantages of Runnable Interface:**

- Better design principle (composition over inheritance)
- Allows class to extend other classes
- More flexible and reusable
- Preferred approach in modern Java development


## Practical Examples

### Hello World Printer

**HelloWorldPrinter.java**

```java
package IntroToThreads;

public class HelloWorldPrinter implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello World from: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

**Client.java**

```java
package IntroToThreads;

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        
        Runnable helloWorldPrinter = new HelloWorldPrinter();
        Thread t = new Thread(helloWorldPrinter);
        t.start();
    }
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Main thread: main
Hello World from: Thread-0
```


### Parallel Execution Demo

**Enhanced HelloWorldPrinter.java**

```java
package IntroToThreads;

public class HelloWorldPrinter implements Runnable {
    
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Something done by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello World from: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        doSomething();
    }
}
```

**Enhanced Client.java**

```java
package IntroToThreads;

public class Client {
    
    public static void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Something is being done by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        
        Runnable helloWorldPrinter = new HelloWorldPrinter();
        Thread t = new Thread(helloWorldPrinter);
        t.start();
        
        doSomething(); // This runs on main thread
    }
}
```

**Expected Output (order may vary):**

```
Thread: main
Something is being done by: main
Hello World from: Thread-0
Something done by: Thread-0
```


### Number Printer with 100 Threads

**NumberPrinter.java**

```java
package printtillhundred;

public class NumberPrinter implements Runnable {
    private int numberToPrint;
    
    NumberPrinter(int numberToPrint) {
        this.numberToPrint = numberToPrint;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Printing " + this.numberToPrint + 
                          ". Printed by Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

**Client.java**

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i) {
            NumberPrinter numberPrinter = new NumberPrinter(i);
            Thread t = new Thread(numberPrinter);
            t.start();
        }
    }
}
```

**Important Observations:**

- Creates 100 threads, each printing one number
- Output order is not guaranteed (demonstrates concurrent execution)
- Each thread completes independently
- Demonstrates the unpredictable nature of thread scheduling

**Sample Output (order will vary):**

```
Printing 1. Printed by Thread Thread-0
Printing 3. Printed by Thread Thread-2
Printing 2. Printed by Thread Thread-1
Printing 5. Printed by Thread Thread-4
...
```

This example perfectly illustrates how multiple threads can execute concurrently, with the OS scheduler determining the execution order.
